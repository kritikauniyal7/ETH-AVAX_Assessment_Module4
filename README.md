# DegenToken-ERC20 Token For Degen Gameing

## Description
DegenToken is an ERC20 token specifically created for the Degen Gaming platform operating on the Avalanche network. It serves as a versatile digital asset within the platform, enabling players to earn rewards, conduct peer-to-peer transfers, and exchange tokens for in-game items offered in the platform's store. This smart contract builds upon the OpenZeppelin library, incorporating functionalities such as token creation (primarily for the platform's administrator), token transfers, and token removal. Furthermore, users have the capability to exchange their tokens for various in-game items available in the platform's store.

## Getting Started
### Problem Statement
Are you up for a challenge that will put your skills to the test? Degen Gaming üéÆ, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention üß†

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store, but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growthüìà

Are you ready to join forces with Degen Gaming and help turn their vision into a reality? The gaming world is counting on you to take it to the next level. Will you rise to the challenge üí™, or will it be game over ‚ò†Ô∏è for you?

## Challenge
Your task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

1.Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.

2.Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.

3.Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.

4.Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.

5.Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

## Solution Description
This code is a straightforward smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for building smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract offers various functions that interface with our Metacrafter wallet, configured on the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain testnet. You can track all transactions on this testnet via the following link: https://testnet.snowtrace.io. We've deployed this contract using the Remix IDE, which you can access here: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To utilize this smart contract, it's crucial to link your Metamask wallet to the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain Testnet. Additionally, you should add the ability to view transactions on the Avalanche platform's block explorer at https://testnet.snowtrace.io.

## Executing Program
1. Open Remix IDE and create the Smart Contract named " DegenToken.sol " and paste the smart contract code to it.
   
3. Connect Metamask to the Remix IDE with the testnet account having AVAX token for the gas fee.
 
4. Deploy the contract using " Avalanche Fuji C-Chain " account.
  
5. Copy the Deployed contract address and go to https://testnet.snowtrace.io
 
6. Search the coppied address in the search box it will show all the transaction blocks of that smart contract.
 
7. Check All the functionality of my smart contract.
